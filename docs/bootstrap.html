<H2>Introduction</H1>
GUK is normally part of a larger subsystem but can be run stand-alone, e.g.:
<pre>
# xm create -c domain_config
Using config file "./domain_config".
Started domain GUK-root
time: 70673721792504 periodic_thread
...
</pre>
The microkernel gets the startup information from the Xen hypervisor
and provides a set of callbacks to it.  Bootstrapping continues by
setting up the event channels (interrupt handlers) and initializing
pagetables, timers, console and the scheduler.  If SMP is enabled,
i.e. vcpus > 1 in the domain config file, the remaining cpus are
activated after the scheduler is initialized. If the <code>BRIDGE</code>
environment variable is set to the name of the network bridge, the domain
will be configured with a network interface.
<p>
To support null pointer checks, the page at virtual address 0 is then
mapped out.
<p>
The microkernel services are then started, these are:
<ul>
<li>Network (netfront)
<li>Block device (blk_front)
<li>Sibling guest file system (fs-front)
<li>Shutdown (suspend/resume)
</ul>
<p>
If debugging is enabled, the db-backend thread is created, which will
wait for a connection from the debugging front-end before continuing
the microkernel.  Otherwise, the function <code>guk_app_main</code> is invoked. The
microkernel provides a weak definition of this function which creates
a thread that prints the time (in nanoseconds) to both the console and
the Xen console every 500 ms.  The network is handled in a similar
way, the function <code>guk_net_app_main</code> being called
with the MAC address, or NULL if no network is configured. Incoming packets
invoke the <code>guk_netif_rx</code> method. Both of these methods are given
weak definitions in GUK, the default <code>guk_netif_rx</code> just prints a
message to the console. The 
<p>
When the microkernel is used as part of
a larger system, that system must provide a strong definition of
<code>guk_app_main</code> that will override the weak definition.  Note that any
definition of <code>guk_app_main</code> must create a thread to contain its
activity and return, at which point the microkernel switches to the
idle thread for VCPU 0. A similar override should be used for the network methods.
<p>
The startup can be traced by placing <code>-XX:GUKTrace:startup</code> in the
<code>extra</code> command line argument.
