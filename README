GuestVM Microkernel
===================

The GuestVM Microkernel (GUK) is a derivative of the Xen Minimal OS
(mini-os) that is used to support the Guest VM Java platform. It can
be run stand-alone, although there is some code that assumes that it
is supporting Guest VM, or at least a JVM.

It requires a 64-bit x86 machine and hypervisor.

Building
========

Set the environment variable XEN_ROOT to the root of your Xen distribution
and then execute gmake.

The debugging support and file-system support via sibling Linux guest
are in tools/db-front and tools/fs-back, respectively. There are not
built by default as they must be built on Linux and installed in the
Linux guest in which they will execute.

Running
=======

To start it do the following in domain0 (assuming xend is running)

# xm create -c domain_config

This starts the kernel and then once every second prints the system time.

If the environment variable BRIDGE is set to the name of the network bridge
then incoming network packets are also reported on the console.

License
=======

The GuestVM Microkernel is licensed under GPL V2.

=========
